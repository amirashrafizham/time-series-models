# 0. What Are Time Series?

- A time series is any data or series that is indexed in time order. Examples include stock prices, weather data, and sales figures.
- It is different than regular supervised learning because the data points are not independent of each other. The value at one time point can be influenced by previous time points. There is no temporal dependency in regular supervised learning.
